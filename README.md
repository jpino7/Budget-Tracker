# Budget Tracker

## Description
Creating a budget tracker with React. This project required me to break up my app's UI into components, manage components state, and respond to user events.
This project has a form to input an expense, a history to view expenses, and a running total to keep track of expenses. User is able to input an expense consisting of a dollar amount.
